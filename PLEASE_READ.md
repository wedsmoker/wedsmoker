# 🙏 A quick note from the maintainer

Hey—thanks for cloning this repo.  
I built this because I needed it, and if you’re using it too, that genuinely means a lot.

**Do whatever you want with it.** Fork it, break it, embed it in your company’s secret AI lab—I don’t care.  
But if you **find it useful** (or **useless**), I’d really appreciate a quick email:  
👉 **hello@wwel.sh**

No pressure. No tracking. No corporate fluff.  
Just one builder to another.
